Java as the scripting language
gui editor app
runner app
runner app looks at config files to configure and run game (what scripts to load, game info, etc)
uses ECS
graphics are done via wrapper lib loaded via macros defined at runtime
maybe window too?
start with raylib backend graphics, can use other graphics engines later
