Java as the scripting language
gui editor app
runner app
runner app looks at config files to configure and run game (what scripts to load, game info, etc)
uses ECS
graphics are done via wrapper lib loaded via macros defined at runtime
maybe window too?
start with raylib backend graphics, can use other graphics engines later

versions:
- lib (non-executable)
- engine (game-dynamic executable)
- editor (executable)

- need script to
  1. compile lib
  2. compile engine
  3. compile editor

  for now run script just rungs the engine main.c executable, but later it should go ahead and just compile the engine, and then compile the editor, and then run the editor.

officially, on release, the compile script should ask
what option you want to compile for, do you want to
compile a lib zip folder, or do you want to compile
the editor, or do you want to manually compile a game
given a resources directory or something
